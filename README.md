New York City is a prime example of a busteling metropolitan: with close to 9 Million inhabitants and a population density of 27,000 people per square mile, the big apple is one of the world's most congested cities in terms of traffic. More importantly, the city registers close to 250 000 yearly vehicule collisions, with around 25% of these accidents leading to injuries. According to the New York Police Department, the traffic accidents caused injuries to more than 35,000 drivers and passengers, nearly 11,000 pedestrians, and 3,900 cyclists in 2014 alone.

On average, 3 people die in car accidents and around 50 are injured on a daily basis. However, the losses don't stop here. In 2013, the total costs of crash-related deaths in New York were estimated to close to 1.6 Billion dollars making the reduction of vehicule collisions and especially eliminating traffic deaths a priority for the state of New York.

The goal of this RAMP is to predict the number of accidents per ZIPCODE per hour.


#### Set up

Open a terminal and

1. install the `ramp-workflow` library (if not already done)
  ```
  $ pip install git+https://github.com/paris-saclay-cds/ramp-workflow.git
  ```


2. Follow the ramp-kits instructions from the [wiki](https://github.com/paris-saclay-cds/ramp-workflow/wiki/Getting-started-with-a-ramp-kit)

#### Local notebook

Get started on this RAMP with the [dedicated notebook](NYC_nb_accidents.ipynb).


3. install the `google_drive_downloader` library (if not already done) in order
   to download the data.

  ```
    $ pip install google_drive_downloader
    ```

#### Help
Go to the `ramp-workflow` [wiki](https://github.com/paris-saclay-cds/ramp-workflow/wiki) for more help on the [RAMP](http:www.ramp.studio) ecosystem.
